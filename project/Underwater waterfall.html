    <h1><center><p>Underwater waterfall</p><center></h1>
<hr>
<h3><center> It is located in the Indian Ocean, near the shores of Le Morne Brabant, south-west of Mauritius</center></h3>
<h3><center> Mauritius has an original relief since surrounded by a coral reef. In addition, the undercurrents, silt deposits and sand, moving under the action of underwater currents, create visibility of the underwater waterfall. These deceptive landscapes seem bizarre cascades, and their eddy jets fall directly to the ocean bottom. Transparency of the water also plays an important role.</center></h3>
<h3><center> The island of Le Morant Brabant has only 30 acres of land</center></h3>
